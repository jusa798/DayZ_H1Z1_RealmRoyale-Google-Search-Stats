# DayZ_H1Z1_RealmRoyale-Google-Search-Stats

Just a quick look into the searches between the three battle royale games.

I always find myself playing one or two video games at time. Any more is too much, and sometimes just one may be enough, especially for the battle royale genre. With this logic, I was curious to see if there was a negative correlation between DayZ, H1Z1, and Realm Royale.
