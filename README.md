# DayZ_H1Z1_RealmRoyale-Google-Search-Stats
**Just a quick look into the searches between the three battle royale games.**

  
  I always find myself playing one or two video games at time. Any more is too much, and sometimes just one may be enough, especially for the battle royale genre. With this logic, I was curious to see if there was a negative correlation between DayZ, H1Z1, and Realm Royale. 

  
  I received the google search statistics from Google Analytics. It came as a CSV, which needed a little cleaning. 

  
  As you can see from figure 1, there are huge spikes in the search statistics (from Google) for Realm Royale and H1Z1, but not DayZ. The popularity of DayZ also dramatically dropped. The graph was set to the last five years. 

  
  Figure 2 begins with June 3rd, 2018, which was right before release date for Realm Royale. Especially with this graph, the huge search spikes are even more noticeable. It seems that these battle royale games seem to struggle with keeping players, but can have momentous opportinuties as well. 

  
  My hypothesis of any negative correlation seems to be pretty wrong with this graph. The correlation matrix also shows a negligible negative -.17 correlation between Realm Royale and DayZ, an even more negligible -.05 correlation between DayZ and H1Z1, and then a weak positive relationship between Realm Royale and H1Z1. As more time passes, and these games go through more and more changes, it will be interesting to see the search statistics in the future.
